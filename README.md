# Advent of Code

Solutions for Advent of Code in different languages. Currently Python as main platform. Using this for learning new languages and to recapture old knowledge in C.
Currently migrating my python solutions from another repo, why not all solutions are available yet.

## Year 2015
+ 47 &#11088; in Python 3.9 (all except day 22 and final part of day 25)
+ 6 &#11088; in C (days 1 - 3)

## Year 2016
+ 16 &#11088; in Python 3.9 (days 1 - 8)
+ 10 &#11088; C (days 3, 5, 6, 7, 8)

## Year 2017
+ 2 &#11088; in C (day 1)

## Year 2020
+ 14 &#11088;Python (days 1 - 7)

## Year 2021
+ 42 &#11088; in [Python](python/README.md)
+ 18 &#11088; in [C](C/README.md)
+ 2 &#11088; in PHP (day 1)

### Why taking on the Advent of Code
An excellent way to learn new programming languages and to train and practice on old skills. My goal is to implement solutions as far as possible for a number of different programming languages. Some may never happen, but maybe I get the chance to learn something new. Most curious on Rust, Kotlin and Haskell. 

### Started but far from completed (may never be):
+ PHP

### Upcoming languages to try out which I have not started yet:
+ Rust
+ Elixir
+ Haskell
+ Go
+ JavaScript
+ TypeScript
+ Java
+ Kotlin
+ Julia
+ C#
+ C++
