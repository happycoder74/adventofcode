# Advent of Code

Solutions for Advent of Code in different languages. Currently Python as main platform. Using this for learning new languages and to recapture old knowledge in C.
Currently migrating my python solutions from another repo, why not all solutions are available yet.

### Why taking on the Advent of Code
An excellent way to learn new programming languages and to train and practice on old skills. My goal is to implement solutions as far as possible for a number of different programming languages. Some may never happen, but maybe I get the chance to learn something new. Most curious on Rust, Kotlin and Haskell. 


### Upcoming languages to try out which I have not started yet:
+ [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
+ Elixir
+ Haskell
+ Go
+ JavaScript
+ TypeScript
+ Java
+ Kotlin
+ Julia
+ C#
+ C++
