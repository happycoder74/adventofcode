# Advent of Code in C++  

Taking on the challenge to solve AoC in C with Glib ( and even worse in plain C ) made me remember how big the difference is between Python and C. And also how much more fun, but at the same time frustrating, it is when you are (or need to be) in full control over what your code is actually doing. No magic behind the scenes, just pure memory shuffling.

However, sometimes it is nice to get a little lazy and you stare with owe at the C++ STL and all the beautiful library functions available. So I decided to try out C++ in order to get the best of both worlds. Still in control, but with some useful toolkits available. I am aiming to learn the modern C++ and will aim to learn C++ 20 standard. Will take some iterations before I can utilize the full potential of the library functions. Some of the code will be near C to start with.

While I try to learn the benefits and caveats of C++ I also decided to take on the challenge to learn CMake, why this part of the repo is built using CMake. Will be interesting.
