# Advent of Code in C

Stepping up the game a notch for me! Trying to solve the problems using C.

Due to some laziness I am utilizing GLib at least to start with. Goal is to finish the puzzles using plain old C.

A messy Makefile is included which allows to run the solutions from the adventofcode/C direcory using the command:

```make run YEAR=<year> DAY=<day>```

or to just build the solution:

```make YEAR=<year> DAY=<day>```

where ```<year>``` is pretty self explanatory and ```<day>``` is the number of the day (with leading zero for day 1 to 9, e.g 01, 02 etc).
